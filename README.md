This is just bash scripts i use to automate tasks that and save time. These scripts are for me, i am new to Github and use it to access my scripts on all my devices, i doubt anyone else can use them. 

To use clone repo, use the chmod command to set file permissions, for example chmid +x filename.sh and run the scripts, ./filename.sh
